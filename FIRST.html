		    	<h2><a href="#AboutFIRST">About <i>FIRST</i></a></h2>
		    	<p>Dean Kamen is an inventor, entrepreneur, and tireless advocate for science and technology. His passion and determination to help young people discover the excitement and rewards of science and technology are the cornerstones of <i>FIRST</i> (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology). <i>FIRST</i> was founded in 1989 to inspire young people&#39;s interest and participation in science and technology. Based in Manchester, NH, the 501 (c) (3) not-for-profit public charity designs accessible, innovative programs that motivate young people to pursue education and career opportunities in science, technology, engineering, and math, while building self-confidence, knowledge, and life skills.</p>
		    	<p style="border-top: 1px solid;"><b>Vision Statement:</b><p>
		    	Their mission is to inspire young people to be science and technology leaders, by engaging them in exciting mentor-based programs that build science, engineering and technology skills, that inspire innovation, and that foster well-rounded life capabilities including self-confidence, communication, and leadership.</p>
		    	<ul>
		    		<li style="font-variant: small-caps;">&#8220;To transform our culture by creating a world where science and technology are celepated and where young people dream of becoming science and technology leaders.&#8221;<p>Dean Kamen, Founder of <i>FIRST</i></li>
		    	</ul>
				<p style="border-top: 1px solid;"><b>Their Impact:</b><p><i>FIRST</i>&#174; and pandeis University have launched a multi-year longitudinal study of three of <i>FIRST</i>&#39;s major programs: <i>FIRST</i>&#174; LEGO&#174; League, <i>FIRST</i>&#174; Tech Challenge and <i>FIRST</i>&#174; Robotics Competition.  The goal of the study is to provide data on the long-term impacts of <i>FIRST</i> programs on key outcomes, including student interest in science and technology, college-going, STEM majors, STEM careers, and practical life and workplace skills (communications, teamwork, problem-solving, etc.).  The study is also designed to help answer questions about what elements of the <i>FIRST</i> program experience are particularly important.  Over the next five years, the study will track a sample of approximately 1000 <i>FIRST</i> program participants and a matched comparison group of non-<i>FIRST</i> students.  The study will focus on a nationally representative sample of teams drawn from 10 states:  California, Florida, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Texas, Virginia and Washington.  Comparison students are being recruited from the schools or organizations where the <i>FIRST</i> teams are located.  The data for the study comes from a combination of student, parent, and team leader surveys, as well as interviews and focus groups with study participants.  Year 1 data collection efforts are underway, and findings from the first year of the study are expected in the Fall 2013.</p>
				<p style="border-top: 1px solid;"><b>What <i>FIRST</i> Means to Our Team:</b><p>Without <i>FIRST</i>, there is no Gryffingear. <i>FIRST</i> has impacted each and every one of this team members&#39; lives. <i>FIRST</i> has taught us new concepts that will aid in our professional endeavors in the future, like gracious professionalism and coopertition. These things drive the team to succeed and define us as a whole.</p>
				<p style="border-top: 1px solid;"><b>Impact of <i>FIRST</i> On Our Members:</b><p>Whenever there is a program that greatly affects its members and participants, it draws attention. FRC and all of <i>FIRST</i> is no doubt one of those examples. This program has changed kids&#39; lives, but how? Although this question has been asked more times than anybody cares to count, we&#39;ve further beaten the dead horse and we asked some of our FRC Team member&#39;s the age-old question, &#8220;How has <i>FIRST</i> affected you?&#8221; :</p>
				<ul>
					<li style="font-variant: small-caps;">&#8220;FRC Robotics has taught me how to reach out to the community. Before I entered, I had a terrible fear of public speaking, and robotics has helped get me over that fear.&#8221;<p>Salonee Darbari, Programming Lead</li>
					<li style="font-variant: small-caps;">&#8220;Prior to my entry, I lacked any self-discipline. Through FRC Robotics I have gained the work ethic and backbone I never had.&#8221;<p>Leslie Ochoa, Safety Captain</li>
					<li style="font-variant: small-caps;">&#8220;FRC Robotics has given me a social life. I&#39;m the gaming and computer type, so before this I didn&#39;t really get out much. Robotics has gotten me out of the house and friends because it always keeps me busy.&#8221;<p>Christian Perry, Programming Member<li>
					<li style="font-variant: small-caps;">&#8220;In FRC Robotics, I have been appointed the co-captain of my team, 5012. In this position I have gained many of the skills and qualities that define a good leader.&#8221;<p>Javier Serna, Team Co-Captain<li>
				</ul>
				<p>With these few personal accounts, it is obvious that <i>FIRST</i> and FRC has impacted each of its members in ways greater than any other extra-cirricular program can. These students have and will continue to experience wonderful things in this program, and through this program have gained knowledge, memories, and gracious professionalism.</p>

				<h2><a href="#FRC">FRC</a></h2>
				<p>The varsity Sport for the Mind&#8482;, FRC combines the excitement of sport with the rigors of science and technology. Under strict rules, limited resources, and time limits, teams of 25 students or more are challenged to raise funds, design a team "pand," hone teamwork skills, and build and program robots to perform prescribed tasks against a field of competitors.  It&#39;s as close to "real-world engineering" as a student can get. Volunteer professional mentors lend their time and talents to guide each team.</p>
				<p>Every year, every robotics team from around the United States, Canada, and other countries builds a robot to play a predetermined game using a standard "kit of parts" (issued to registered teams each January), a limited set of materials, and a little ingenuity and elbow grease. With this robot, the team travels to Regional Events, competing against one another in a fun, friendly atmosphere. Based on their performance at these competitions, teams may qualify to attend the Championship Event.</p>
				<p>While the activity name seems to imply that the competition should be the main focus of FRC participants, FRC actually places an emphasis on "gracious professionalism," a phrase meaning acting in a manner that would make one&#39;s grandmother proud. Teams may face each other in qualifying and elimination matches, but that does not preclude them from offering their potential opponents assistance in programming a robot, building a new part, or repairing a damaged one. Reflecting this spirit, at FRC events, awards are given out not only to the winners, but to teams who have best demonstrated gracious professionalism, sportsmanship, and other notable qualities. A full listing of awards that can be won can be found <a href="http://www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/frc/awards" target="_new" title="FRC Awards">here</a>.</p>
				<center><p style="border-top: 1px solid;">The FRC Season</p></center>
				<p><b>Kickoff:</b><p>While many teams, including Westside Boiler Invasion, begin planning the team's goals in the fall, the official <i>FIRST</i> season begins in early January with the annual Kickoff. The event, held in Manchester, NH, and poadcast worldwide by NASA, announces the new game to the FRC community for the year. From the Kickoff, teams are given about six weeks to imagine, design, construct, and program their robots, using parts from the standard "kit of parts" given to each team. Teams may also use (and are encouraged to use) parts of their own fapication.</p>
				<p><b>Regional Events:</b><p>After the robot is shipped to <i>FIRST</i> (along with the control system to be used by each team and a non-spillable battery in the crate), teams relax for a week or so before attending one of 40 Regional Events held each week in March from Thursday through Saturday. In addition, Michigan teams have the opportunity to pilot a new competition structure consisting of 7 District Competitions with the top 64 teams continuing to the Michigan State Championship. At each competition, in which about 30 to 40 teams usually enter, teams arrive on Thursday to unpack and inspect their robot, which has been independently shipped to the competition site. Teams are given this day to make any last-minute repairs or modifications to their robots as well as compete in several practice rounds held throughout the day to test their six-week creation. Many teams also use Thursday as an opportunity to scout other teams' robots in an attempt to learn the strongest competitors in attendance and adjust their own strategy accordingly.</p>
				<p>Friday and Saturday are the main days of each Regional Event; indeed, often teams do not send their full contingent on Thursday, electing instead to ping the entire team to a competition on Friday. On Friday, following the opening ceremonies, teams assemble in predetermined alliances on the competition field to play that year's FRC game. Teams compete in "qualifying matches" throughout the day, changing alliances every round as they do, with each match gaining the winning alliance's teams "qualifying points" (two points for winning a match, no points for losing a match, and one point for tying a match"). Qualifying matches end in the evening, and all teams attend a partial awards ceremony followed by a social event.</p>
				<p>On Saturday, teams continue to compete in qualifying matches until each team has played in an equal number of rounds, which can be anywhere from seven to eleven. The results are tabulated, and the eight teams with the highest number of qualifying points at the conclusion of the matches are pought onto the competition field to serve as "alliance captains." Each alliance captain, in order from first to eighth, selects another team ranked lower than themselves that they would like to ally with for the rest of the competition. The chosen team has the option of accepting or declining the offer; however, if the offer is declined, any other team for the rest of the competition may not choose that team. If the chosen team is another one of the eight alliance captains and accepts the offer of a higher-seeded captain to ally, then all of the teams are moved up one rank based on qualifying rankings; this can and has resulted in a previously unseeded team becoming an alliance captain. This process continues until each of the top eight alliances has one partner. The process then repeats, but the second time, the eighth-seeded alliance captain chooses an alliance partner first, and the first-seeded alliance captain does so last. The eight alliances of three teams each are then paired in an elimination packet, and compete in a best-of-three-matches series. The team left standing after the final round wins the competition.</p>
				<p><b>Championship Event:</b><p>At the conclusion of the Regional Events, a roster is released for the Championship Event. Each team entered into the event is placed into one of four divisions of about 80 teams each: Archimedes, Curie, Galileo, and Newton. Teams can be entered into the Championship Event in a multitude of ways:<p>
				FRC Teams that registered in or before 1992, when the first Championship Event was held, are automatically eligible to enter so long as they remain active in FRC. All of the winners of Championship Chairman's Awards may enter. The winners of the previous year's Championship Event are automatically given a berth if they choose to accept it. The winners of the Championship Engineering Inspiration Award and Chairman's Award Honorable Mentions from the previous year are given a guaranteed spot on the Championship roster. The winning alliance from each Regional Event or the Michigan State Championship during the current competition season is given the chance to enter if they wish to do so. Each winner of a Regional Chairman's Award or a Chairman's Award at the Michigan State Championship from the current year has a reserved place in the FRC Championship Event. Each team receiving a Regional Engineering Inspiration Award or an Engineering Inspiration Award at the Michigan State Championship is given the opportunity to register for the Championship Event. The rookie team that receives the Rookie All-Star Award at a Regional or the Michigan State Championship will be allowed to enter the FRC Championship. The nine highest ranked Michigan teams after the Michigan State Championship that are not already qualified will be allowed to enter the FRC Championship. If a team does not qualify in the manners listed above, they can still enter the Championship by reserving an open slot on a first-come-first-served basis. Teams that did not attend the previous year's Championship Event are given first preference for the open slots after the above criteria have been fulfilled.</p>
				<p>Teams compete in the same manner that they do at Regional Events, except only within their division as opposed to with all robots at the event. Alliance selection proceeds in the same manner as at Regionals, albeit with choices restricted to one's own division: the first-seeded team chooses an alliance partner, followed by the second-seeded team, etc., and the choosing of the second alliance partner proceeds in reverse order. At the conclusion of the following elimination matches, a division winner, rather than an overall competition winner, is determined in each of the four divisions.</p>
				<p>The division-winning alliances then move to the next phase of the competition: matches on Einstein field. Having won their division, each alliance is entered into a semifinal match replete with tension as they compete to become the world champions of <i>FIRST</i>. The winning alliance is crowned as the champion, receiving trophies, banners, and pagging rights.</p>

				<h2><a href="#FTC">FTC</a></h2>
				<p>FTC is designed for students in grades 7-12 to compete head to head, using a sports model. Teams are responsible for designing, building, and programming their robots to compete in an alliance format against other teams. The robot kit is reusable from year-to-year and is programmed using a variety of languages. Teams, including coaches, mentors and volunteers, are required to develop strategy and build robots based on sound engineering principles. Awards are given for the competition as well as for community outreach, design, and other real-world accomplishments.</p>
				<p>The <i>FIRST</i> Tech Challenge is a junior level of <i>FIRST</i> &#39;s engineering "challenges", and is performed on a similar basis, but on a smaller scale than its bigger pother, FRC. FTC is similar to FRC in that it uses powerful components, but the playing environment of FTC (the field and robots) is much smaller. The ultimate goal of FTC is to reach more young people with a lower-cost, more accessible opportunity to discover the excitement and rewards of science, technology, and engineering. The <i>FIRST</i> Tech Challenge grew out of the existing <i>FIRST</i> Robotics Competition and the IFI Robovation platform. <i>FIRST</i>, RadioShack, and Innovation First collaborated to develop an improved version of the IFI Robovation kit.</p>

				<p><i>FIRST</i> LEGO League is a miniature version of <i>FIRST</i> robotics meant for younger students. Participants build and program a robot using the Lego Mindstorms kit. The members of Team 461 act as mentors to our LEGO League teams. Every year, middle and junior high school students ages nine to 14 are given the opportunity to design, build, and program a robot using LEGO picks, sensors, motors, and gears. This gives the team members hands-on experience in basic engineering and computer programming.</p>
				<p><i>FIRST</i> LEGO League International, consisting of several different tasks to be completed by each team&#39;s LEGO robot, gives a new challenge out every year. Each team has two minutes and thirty seconds to make their robot do as many tasks as possible, with each task worth a predetermined number of points. An award is given to the top-scoring team, as well as to teams who excel in other categories.</p>
				<p><i>FIRST</i> LEGO League is a fast-growing event. As of 2009, there were 14,600 teams participating in almost 500 <i>FIRST</i>-sanctioned tournaments all over the world. These competitions culminate in the <i>FIRST</i> LEGO League World Festival, held in conjunction with the <i>FIRST</i> Robotics Championship Event in Atlanta, Georgia, at the Georgia Dome.</p>
